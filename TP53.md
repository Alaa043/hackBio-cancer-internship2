**_What is TP53?_**

TP53 ( Tumor protein p53 ) this protein acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it regulates cell division by keeping cells from growing and dividing (proliferating) too fast or in an uncontrolled way.

The p53 protein is located in the nucleus of cells throughout the body, where it attaches (binds) directly to DNA. When the DNA in a cell becomes damaged by agents such as toxic chemicals, radiation, or ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight, this protein plays a critical role in determining whether the DNA will be repaired or the damaged cell will self-destruct (undergo apoptosis). If the DNA can be repaired, p53 activates other genes to fix the damage. If the DNA cannot be repaired, this protein prevents the cell from dividing and signals it to undergo apoptosis. By stopping cells with mutated or damaged DNA from dividing, p53 helps prevent the development of tumors.

**_The importance of TP53 as biomarker:_**

 Several observations lead investigators to consider the _TP53_ mutation pattern as a useful biomarker of mutagenesis: (1) mutations in _TP53_ are mostly missense and very diverse in their position and nature, allowing compilation and comparison of tumor-specific mutation spectra; (2) these point mutations are clustered in exons 4–9 (more than 80%) which facilitates analysis; (3) there is a large data set of mutation information on _TP53_, which is compiled in a dedicated, central database ([http://www-p53.iarc.fr](http://www-p53.iarc.fr/)).

Loss of p53 function has been related to the widespread presence of _TP53_ mutations in a variety of human malignancies that are essential for the growth of cancers . Limited studies have shown that _p53_ mutation is absent in a few cases. However, the majority of cancers do contain _TP53_ mutation. Hence, for diagnostic purposes, the identification of alterations in _TP53_ can be a helpful indicator.

**_Applications of TP53:_**

1- Cancer Therapy and Prevention:

TP53 is a tumor-suppressor gene that guards against cancer development. Unfortunately, it’s mutated in more than half of all human cancers. These mutations not only impair its antitumor activity but also give rise to oncogenic properties in the mutant p53 protein.

Researchers have explored various strategies for targeting mutant p53 in cancer therapy. Some approaches directly aim at restoring wild-type p53 functions or eliminating mutant p53. However, these treatments can be quite specific to the protein’s structure and the type of cancer.

An alternative approach involves exploiting synthetic lethality. This concept suggests that disrupting two genes with synthetic lethal interactions (where either gene alone can survive, but both together result in cell death) could be an effective strategy. [Instead of directly targeting p53, scientists look for genes that interact synthetically with mutant p53 to enhance therapeutic benefits<sup>1</sup>](https://jhoonline.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13045-021-01169-0).

2- Noncoding RNAs and Synthetic Lethality:

Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have gained attention in cancer research. Disrupting ncRNA networks can have favorable antitumor effects. Researchers are investigating whether targeting noncoding RNAs could serve as synthetic lethal targets in cancers with p53 mutations.

Essentially, this means that by interfering with specific noncoding RNAs, we might selectively kill cancer cells with mutant p53 while sparing normal cells. [It’s an exciting avenue for potential therapies<sup>1</sup>](https://jhoonline.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13045-021-01169-0).

Beyond Cancer3-3

While p53 is often associated with cancer, it has broader implications. Here are a few:

DNA Repair: p53 helps maintain genomic stability by promoting DNA repair mechanisms.

Cell-Cycle Control: It regulates cell division, preventing abnormal growth.

Senescence: p53 contributes to cellular aging and prevents uncontrolled proliferation.

Autophagy: It’s involved in cellular recycling and maintaining homeostasis.

Apoptosis: p53 triggers programmed cell death when necessary.

Beyond cancer, there’s evidence that TP53 is associated with fertility, aging, and longevity. [Moreover, genetic variants in TP53 may play a role in environmental adaptation](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/12/3/512)**__**
